# CARST
Caving Automated Rapid Survey Tool

A project designed to tackle the issues of accessibility to digital cave survey tools. 
Existing devices are either out of production or are a high cost, making them hard to
get for any except the most dedicated caver. CARST aims to use mostly off the shelf
components and open-source firmware to eliminate the high cost of entry. The goals for
this project include full integration with existing with existing survey software,
such as TopoDroid and PocketTopo, reliable error detection, self-calibration, the 
ability to store multiple surveys on the device, and durability from the harsh 
conditions present within a cave enviroment.
